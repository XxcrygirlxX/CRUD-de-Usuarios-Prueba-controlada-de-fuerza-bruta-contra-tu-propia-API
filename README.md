In order to carry out the attack, the following requirements must be taken into account:
have Python 3.8+, have bash to be able to run attack.sh, have the Linux or wsl environment in Windows to run the bash script, and use a virtual environment for the API. Here you will be given permissions to bash, as we can see in the image.
The attack is carried out by running the attack.sh script, which will execute the bash script. The bash script will then execute the API script, which will execute the attack.sh script again. This process will continue until the attack is successful.
